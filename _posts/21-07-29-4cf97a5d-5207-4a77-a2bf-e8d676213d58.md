<div dir="auto"><div dir="auto">There are two changes operating on humans- biological evolution and cultural evolution. </div><div dir="auto"> Basically we can say implicit knowledge is important in biological evolution. Because Genes which drive our biological evolution are form of implicit knowledge. Likewise other instincts also are form of implicit knowledge.</div><div dir="auto">In cultural evolution explicit knowledge takes centre stage.Books,scientific papers,internet are all forms of explicit knowledge.</div><div dir="auto">Learning ,though having implicit knowledge component, is basically increasing our explicit knowledge. That is why it is difficult for animals and also many humans. It is not restricted to our genetic heritage. We literally go beyond genes.Animals are constrained by knowledge encapsulated in their genes, and limited to survival purpose. Man is driven by curiosity to go beyond survival and literally creating new universe( of science,inventions, arts) . That is why we are &quot;creative&quot;.</div><div dir="auto">Walking can be said to be implicit knowledge. If we describe/explain how we walk it becomes explicit knowledge. It is much more difficult to know how we walk.That is why we are not suceeded  in enabling Robots to walk.<br></div></div>
